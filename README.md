## Overview

A utility library for Android to schedule one-time or periodic jobs while your app is running. Currently, Android OS supports 3 types of scheduling APIs: `Handler`, `AlarmManager` and `JobScheduler`. The choice of one suitable API, the inflexibility of switching between them and the amount of boilerplate code required for setting up makes it difficult to use these APIs. 
Want to know more on this and wondering why you should prefer using this library over doing it yourself. Check out the [blog post](https://blog.hypertrack.io/?p=6713). 

[android-job](https://github.com/evernote/android-job) is a similar scheduling library, which unifies `AlarmManager`, `GcmNetworkManager` & `JobScheduler` APIs. But when it comes to implementing network dependent jobs for an interval less than `30sec` or implementing jobs while the device is in PowerSaver Mode, it is not able to schedule such jobs as required. This is where `smart-scheduler` library gives an advantage over `android-job`.

## Download

Download the [latest version](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/hypertrack/smart-scheduler/) or grab via Gradle:

The library is available on `mavenCentral()` and `jcenter()`. In your module's `build.gradle`, add the following code snippet and run the gradle-sync.

```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
	
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.leducanh15:SmartScheduler:1.0.0'
    ...
}
```

If you didn't turn off the manifest merger from the Gradle build tools, then no further step is required to setup the library. Otherwise you manually need to add the permissions and services like in this [AndroidManifest](https://github.com/hypertrack/smart-scheduler-android/blob/master/smart-scheduler/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml). 

## Usage

![Demo App](http://i.imgur.com/X53klUZ.gif?1)

* The class `SmartScheduler` serves as the entry point. You need to create a `Job` object with the corresponding job parameters using the `Job.Builder` class.

* The `Job.Builder` class has many extra options, e.g. you can specify a required network connection, required charging state, make the job periodic or run the job at an exact time.

```
	SmartScheduler.JobScheduledCallback callback = new SmartScheduler.JobScheduledCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onJobScheduled(Context context, Job job) {
            // Handle onJobScheduled here
        }
    };

    Job.Builder builder = new Job.Builder(JOB_ID, callback, jobType, JOB_PERIODIC_TASK_TAG)
            .setRequiredNetworkType(networkType)
            .setRequiresCharging(requiresCharging)
            .setIntervalMillis(intervalInMillis);

    if (isPeriodic) {
        builder.setPeriodic(intervalInMillis);
    }

    Job job = builder.build();
```

* Each job has a unique ID. This ID helps to identify the job later to update requirements or to cancel the job. In case this unique ID is not specified in the `Job` object, one will be auto-generated using `Job.generateJobID()` method.

* Once a `Job` object has been created with the relevant parameters, you can add this job using `SmartScheduler` class.

```
	SmartScheduler jobScheduler = SmartScheduler.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
    boolean result = jobScheduler.addJob(job);

    if (result) {
        // Job successfully added here
    }
```

* A `Non-Periodic` Job will be removed automatically once it has been scheduled successfully. For `Periodic` Jobs, call `SmartScheduler.removeJob(jobID)` method to remove the job.

```
	SmartScheduler jobScheduler = SmartScheduler.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
    boolean result = jobScheduler.removeJob(JOB_ID);

	if (result) {
        // Job successfully removed here
    }
``` 

## Utility Methods

* To check if a job (periodic or non-periodic) is currently scheduled for a given jobID, call `SmartScheduler.contains(jobID)` method as depicted below. This method returns `true` in case a `Job` is currently scheduled for the given `jobID`, `false` otherwise.

```
    SmartScheduler jobScheduler = SmartScheduler.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
    boolean result = jobScheduler.contains(JOB_ID);
    
	if (result) {
        // Job currently scheduled
    }    
```

* To get a scheduled Job for a given jobID, call `SmartScheduler.get(jobID)` method as depicted below. This method returns a `Job` object for the given `jobID` in case one is currently scheduled, `null` otherwise.

```
    SmartScheduler jobScheduler = SmartScheduler.getInstance(getApplicationContext());
    Job scheduledJob = jobScheduler.get(JOB_ID);
    
	if (scheduledJob != null) {
        // Valid job has been scheduled for given jobID
    }    
```
